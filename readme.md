## Let me introduce myself

<p align="justify">
Hi, my name is Mickael, I'm iOS Developer and musician from France. 
I became developer after a training at "OpenClassRooms". But let me start from the beginning...
</p>

<p align="justify">
I'm originaly professional musician, bassist to be more precise. 
I started music when I was 8 or 9 years old with guitar.
Some years later, I discovered bass, it was a revelation.
After my highschrool graduation, I decided to live from my passion. 
But I had never learned music.
I just knew which square I had to press... but I did it! In my bedroom, alone with my computer, I learned music theory, 
and in less than a year, I learned to read, write, transcribe, etc, 
and I made my dream come true!
</p>

**_"Ok guys but we're on github not on some musicians forum"_**

<p align="justify">
I have always had 3 passions: music, motorcycles and computers.
My degree was about this last, Electronic and Digital System.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I started my trainning with the same will as for music and I got my diploma!!
At this point, I'm looking for a job and while waiting to find, I continue to learn again and again, more frameworks, good practices, design paterns, etc...   
</p>
